			<p>"Every great dream, begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.” -Harriet Tubman

                <br><br>I remember doing a project in middle school on Harriet Tubman, the woman who lead the underground railroad, and coming across this quote. 
                It has stuck with me ever since. I have had the passion for creativity: reading, writing, drawing, coding even, for the past thirteen years. 
                I have expanded on it in ways I never knew possible, ways I didn’t dream of when I was a kid. But I am grateful, every day, that I have stuck with it close to my heart. 
                
                <br><br>I am an aspiring full-stacked developer who has worked with a pleathora of programs over the years to create web and graphic designs while also learning about web development. 
                As passionate as I am about art work from drawing and writing, web design and developing seems to be an excellent way to bring it all together. 
                I can only hope to expand on this, practicing and learning to keep things simple and inspiring others in the process.
                
                <br><br>There was a lot to learn, and there will be so much more to grasp later on. It has driven me to things I never knew about and hope that I will continue to learn all I can. 
                I continue to aspire to be a full-stacked developer – knowledge of front and back end developing will be useful to everything I want to do. 
                I hope with this knowledge, I will be able to join a team and build projects for others who may need them but not have the skills to do so.</p>
			
			<p>My passion and pride drive creativeness, while also keeping cleanliness, modern and unique approaches to design 
			will make your site one that people enjoy coming back to.</p>
